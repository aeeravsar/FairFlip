# FairFlip ðŸŽ²

**A trustless, on-chain coin flip game where cryptography ensures fairnessâ€”no oracle needed.**

FairFlip lets 2-16 players bet USDT in a winner-takes-all game. The winner is determined through a commit-reveal scheme with XOR-based randomness that makes cheating impossible and true randomness the only winning strategy.

## Core Concept

Players commit hashed secrets â†’ Everyone reveals â†’ XOR all secrets â†’ Hash the result â†’ Winner selected

Since committing random values is the optimal strategy for every player, the game remains fair without trusting anyone or anything external.

## How It Works

### 1. **Commit Phase**
Players generate a random 32-byte secret and submit its hash (commitment) along with their bet. The secret stays privateâ€”only the hash goes on-chain.

### 2. **Join & Lock**
Players join by submitting their commitment and matching the bet amount. Once the game fills (2-16 players), it locksâ€”no new players, no backing out. Your commitment is your bond.

### 3. **Reveal Phase**
Players reveal their secrets within the time limit (configurable: 1 minute to 2 hours). The contract verifies each reveal matches its commitment. Miss the deadline? You forfeit.

### 4. **Settlement**
The contract XORs all revealed secrets together, creating a combined value that no single player could predict. This gets hashed to generate a random seed, which selects the winner from those who revealed.

```solidity
combined = secret1 âŠ• secret2 âŠ• ... âŠ• secretN
seed = keccak256(combined)
winner = revealers[seed % numRevealers]
```

### 5. **Payout**
Winner takes all. Non-revealers lose their bets to the pot, incentivizing honest participation.

## Why It's Fair

- **Game Theory**: Submitting truly random values is the dominant strategyâ€”any pattern makes you predictable
- **Cryptographic Security**: Commit-reveal prevents anyone from changing their value after seeing others
- **No External Dependencies**: No oracles, no VRF services, no trust assumptions beyond Ethereum itself
- **Transparent**: All operations verifiable on-chain

## Security Features

- **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks
- **No Cancellations**: Once committed, you can't back out after seeing others' reveals
- **Time Bounds**: Reveal phase has strict deadlines to prevent stalling
- **Emergency Refund**: If game gets stuck, players can reclaim funds after 7 days
- **Input Validation**: All parameters checked for safety ranges

## Technical Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity 0.8.20
- **Token**: USDT (or any ERC20)
- **Network**: Arbitrum (low fees, fast finality)
- **Development**: Hardhat, Ethers.js v6
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with mainnet fork testing

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # Add your private key and RPC URLs
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests with mainnet fork
npx hardhat test

# Run with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
```

### Deployment

Deploy to Arbitrum:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network arbitrum
```

Deploy mock USDT for testing:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-mock-usdt.js --network arbitrumSepolia
```

## Contract Interface

### For Players

```solidity
// Create a new game
function createGame(
    bytes32 commitHash,     // keccak256(secret)
    uint256 betAmount,      // USDT amount to bet
    uint256 maxPlayers,     // 2-16 players
    uint256 revealDuration  // 60-7200 seconds
)

// Join existing game
function joinGame(
    address creator,
    bytes32 commitHash
)

// Reveal your secret
function reveal(
    address creator,
    bytes32 secret
)

// Trigger settlement (after reveal deadline)
function settle(address creator)
```

### View Functions

```solidity
// Get game state
function getGameInfo(address creator) returns (
    uint256 betAmount,
    uint256 maxPlayers,
    uint256 currentPlayers,
    uint256 revealDuration,
    uint256 revealDeadline,
    bool isActive,
    bool isRevealing
)

// Check if player revealed
function hasPlayerRevealed(address creator, address player) returns (bool)

// Get list of players
function getGamePlayers(address creator) returns (address[])
```

## Game Theory Analysis

FairFlip creates a fascinating game-theoretic environment:

1. **Commitment Binding**: Once you commit, you're locked inâ€”no strategic withdrawal
2. **Reveal Incentive**: Not revealing means losing your bet with 100% certainty
3. **Randomness Optimal**: Any non-random pattern in your secret can be exploited
4. **Nash Equilibrium**: All players committing truly random values

The beauty is that selfish, rational play leads to a fair game for everyone.

## Gas Optimization

- Efficient storage packing in Game struct
- Cleanup function resets storage for gas refunds
- Batch operations where possible
- Events for off-chain indexing instead of storage

## Auditing Considerations

Key areas reviewed for security:
- Reentrancy protection on all external calls
- Integer overflow/underflow (handled by Solidity 0.8+)
- Front-running resistance through commit-reveal
- DoS resistance with time bounds and emergency functions
- Proper randomness generation without modulo bias
